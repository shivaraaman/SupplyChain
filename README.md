#Supply Chain Management System with ERC-20 Token Integration
This project implements a Supply Chain Management System powered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing an ERC-20 token for transactions. The smart contracts are developed using Solidity (v0.8.21), adhering to the latest standards for security and performance. The system features comprehensive supply chain functionalities, including product tracking, ownership transfers, and participant authentication. It also integrates an ERC-20 token contract for managing token-based transactions, enabling seamless and transparent operations.

The project leverages Truffle (v5.11.5) as the development framework, providing robust tools for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts. The Ganache personal blockchain is used to simulate a local Ethereum network for testing, ensuring a secure environment for development.

#Key features include:
Creation and management of participants (Manufacturer, Supplier, Consumer).
Product lifecycle tracking with provenance and timestamp.
Ownership transfer through verified participants, ensuring authenticity.
A fully compliant ERC-20 token for transactions within the supply chain.
This project is ideal for understanding blockchain-based supply chain solutions and demonstrates end-to-end implementation, from writing smart contracts to deploying and testing on a local blockchain. Future iterations aim to integrate front-end applications and deploy the system on public Ethereum testnets like Rinkeby or Goerli.
